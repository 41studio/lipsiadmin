==Lipsiadmin

Lipsiadmin is a new revolutionary admin for your projects.

Is developped by http://www.lipsiasoft.com that use it from 2 years in production enviroments.

Lipsiadmin is based on Ext Js 2.2 framework (with prototype adapter) works with Rails 2+

This admin is for newbie developper but also for experts, is not entirely written in javascript 
because the aim of developper wose build in a agile way web/site apps so we use extjs in a new 
intelligent way a mixin of <tt>old</tt> html and new ajax functions, 
for example ext manage the layout of page, grids, tree and errors, but form are in html code.
