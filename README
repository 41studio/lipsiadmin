WARNING
=======
If you have a table named Items and generate an admin page, search does not work. 
Guess it has something to do with the item object in the extjs code.

REMEMBER
========
Edit config/config.yml
Edit routes after a script/generate lipsiadmin_page
Remove protect_from_forgery from app/application.rb
