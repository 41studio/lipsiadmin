==Lipsiadmin

Lipsiadmin is a new revolutionary admin for your projects.

Is developped by http://www.lipsiasoft.com that use it from 2 years in production enviroments.

Lipsiadmin is based on Ext Js 2.2 framework (with prototype adapter) works with Rails 2+

This admin is for newbie developper but also for experts, is not entirely written in javascript 
because the aim of developper wose build in a agile way web/site apps so we use extjs in a new 
intelligent way a mixin of <tt>old</tt> html and new ajax functions, 
for example ext manage the layout of page, grids, tree and errors, but form are in html code.

==Requirements

Rails 2+
Haml 2+

==Installation

  $ sudo gem install lipsiadmin
  
Then in your config/environment.rb
  
  config.gem "lipsiadmin", :version => "< 4.0"
  
Why we need to specify version?

Simply because we mantain backward compatibility until a 4.0 version.
This mean that before v 4.0 we only do small improvemets, bug fix, doc etc...

If you want install the edge version you can simply do:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/Lipsiasoft/lipsiadmin.git
  
==Examples

now run script/generate and you can see some like:

  Installed Generators
    Builtin: controller, integration_test, mailer, migration, model, etc..
    Lipsiadmin: attachment, backend, backend_page, pdf

So you can do:

  $ script/generate backend # Generate the base admin
  $ script/generate backend_page yourmodel # Generate a "scaffold" for your model
  $ script/generate state_session # Create a "scaffold" for store extjs grid settings in db
  $ script/generate frontend # Generate the base frontend
  $ script/generate attachment # Generate the an attachments
  $ script/generate pdf PdfName # Generate a new pdf document
